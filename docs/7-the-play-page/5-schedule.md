The **Schedule** tab allows you to set up schedules for playlists, control commands, timelines, and media files. You can automate content playback at specific times or days, enabling seamless control of your media without manual intervention. The schedule feature empowers you to customise your playback to suit your timing and preferences.

## Turning on the Scheduler

To activate the scheduler:

1. Navigate to the **Schedule** tab on the play page.
2. Check the box labelled **"Use Schedule"** above the date selection tool to enable the schedule function.

## Interacting with the Scheduler UI

When you select a day from the calendar on the left side of the screen, the UI will update to display the hours of that day, allowing you to assign actions to specific time slots. Each hour is split into 5-minute increments by default, but you can adjust the increments using the time buttons at the bottom of the screen.
