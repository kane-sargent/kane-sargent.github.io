# Queen and Worker Mode

In the Hive system, Queen and Worker Mode establishes a hierarchical structure that simplifies control and synchronization across multiple devices. The Queen device operates as the central hub, managing key settings, playback commands, and content distribution. Worker devices, on the other hand, are dependent on the Queen, syncing to its commands and settings for seamless, frame-accurate playback and operations. This structure is particularly useful for large-scale or multi-device installations, where central control over numerous devices is essential to ensure consistency and precision. Understanding how Queen and Worker Mode operates is crucial for setting up and managing a synchronized, multi-device environment.

## How to Set Up a Queen and Worker System 

Setting up a Queen and Worker system allows for centralized control and synchronized operation across multiple Hive players. The Queen device acts as the primary controller, while the Worker devices follow the Queen’s commands, ensuring synchronized playback and seamless transitions across devices.

### Steps to Set Up the Queen and Worker System:

1. **Assigning the Queen Device:**
   - On the primary Hive player, navigate to the **Settings** tab.
   - Under the **Bee Type** dropdown, select **Queen**.
   - The Queen device will now act as the controller for all Worker devices in the network.

2. **Connecting Worker Devices:**
   - For each additional Hive player, go to the **Settings** tab.
   - Under the **Bee Type** dropdown, select **Worker**.
   - Enter the Queen’s **IP Address** to ensure that the Worker device syncs with the Queen. If there are multiple Hive systems in the network, ensure each Worker device is connected to the correct Queen using the assigned IP address.

By following these steps, your Hive system will be set up with a Queen and Worker hierarchy, allowing for centralized control and seamless coordination.

## Queen and Worker Interface

When a Queen device has Workers connected to it, the interface adjusts slightly to accommodate the added devices and provide centralized control. This setup allows the Queen to manage multiple Workers simultaneously, ensuring synchronized playback and operations.

### Connected Workers

Next to the Queen’s IP address, every connected Worker device will be displayed in a list. This allows for quick identification of all Worker devices that are currently linked to the Queen, as well as monitoring their status and synchronization accuracy.

Each connected Worker will show its unique IP address, and status indicators will reflect whether the Worker is in sync with the Queen. This enables the operator to keep track of all devices effortlessly, making adjustments or troubleshooting as needed.
