# The Map Page: Queen and Worker Mode

In Queen and Worker Mode, the Map Page remains independent on each device. While the Queen device maintains control over broader system operations, the map settings and output regions on Worker devices must be managed individually. Unlike other pages, changes made on the Queen's Map Page do not affect Worker devices. This ensures that each device's mapping can be tailored to its specific needs, allowing flexibility in multi-device setups.

## warp and blend while in queen and worker 

In a Queen and Worker setup, the **Warp and Blend** functionality allows you to upload mapping files to Worker devices and enable calibration mode simultaneously across both the Queen and Workers. This ensures that all devices are properly aligned and calibrated for consistent, high-quality projection or display output.
