- **Controls**: Playback controls for each media file.
  - **Layer select**: View and select which layer the media is triggered on.
  - **Play/Pause** buttons.

- **Codec**: The codec type used by the media.
- **FPS**: The frame rate of the media file.
- **Status**: Indicates whether the media file has uploaded correctly.
- **Manage**: Provides options to execute commands or manage the file.

## Triggering Media While in Queen and Worker Mode

When in **Queen and Worker Mode**, triggering media on the Queen will also trigger content on the Worker devices. When content is triggered, the Worker devices will play the media that has the same numerical ID. For example, triggering asset 1 on the Queen will trigger asset 1 on the Worker devices.

## Deleting Media Assets While in Queen and Worker Mode

Similarly, when deleting an asset from the Queen, the same asset with the same row ID can be deleted from the Worker devices if selected. This ensures that media asset management remains consistent across all connected devices.
