# Warp and Blend

The **Warp and Blend Tab** allows you to configure complex projection setups using third-party calibration systems such as **Vioso** and **Screenberry**. This tab provides advanced tools for mapping, blending, and warping media to create immersive projection environments. By leveraging these external systems, users can ensure precise calibration for multi-projector setups, seamless edge blending, and warping of projections to fit unique surfaces.

| **Setting**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Calibration Mode**   | Tick the checkbox to enable NDI calibration for Vioso, allowing the device to sync with the Vioso camera server and utilise the configured settings.                             |
| **Overlay Regions**    | Outputs the mapping file from the advanced tab over the Vioso calibration. This is useful for applying custom masks or overlays.                                                  |
| **Server Name**        | Enter the NDI server name used in the Vioso calibration system. Typically, this will be the machine name of the calibration server (e.g., in Windows or macOS).                 |
| **NDI Name**           | Enter the NDI stream name from the Vioso calibration server. This establishes the NDI connection for the mapped projection.                                                      |
| **Output Select**      | Choose the desired output from the Vioso calibration file for display.                                                                                                          |
| **Process Resolution (X / Y)** | Set the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) resolution for the selected Vioso mapping file. This resolution should match the output device.                                      |
| **Gamma Adjust**       | Adjust the gamma levels for the Vioso-calibrated projection. This can help balance brightness and contrast across the entire display.                                              |

### Calibrations

Similar to Vioso, the **calibrations list** shows all uploaded Screenberry mapping files. Select the checkbox next to the file you wish to activate. The calibration process will adjust the projection based on the settings in this file.

### Screenberry Settings

The **Screenberry settings** allow for more detailed control over the calibration and projection process. These settings are specific to the Screenberry system and allow for accurate projection warping and blending.

## Warp and Blend While in Queen and Worker Mode

In a Queen and Worker setup, the **Warp and Blend** functionality allows you to upload mapping files to Worker devices and enable calibration mode simultaneously across both the Queen and Workers. This ensures that all devices are properly aligned and calibrated for consistent, high-quality projection or display output.

## Importing Calibration Files

Both Vioso and Screenberry setups rely on calibration files to function. You can easily **import** these files using the **Import** button located on the Warp and Blend page.

1. Click the **Import** button.
2. Select the appropriate calibration file from your computer.
3. Once imported, the calibration file will appear in the calibrations list, and you can activate it by checking the relevant box.
