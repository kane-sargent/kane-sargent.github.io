# Simple Mapping Tab

The **Simple Mapping Page** is designed to provide users with an intuitive and quick setup for basic media display configurations. It ensures that media is properly sized and positioned on the output screen, serving as a central hub for configuring the visual output of media. Users can adjust how content is displayed with various positioning and sizing options, making it ideal for both simple tasks and more complex, tailored project requirements.

When your video files don’t match the resolution of your output, you need to decide how the videos will be rendered. The following options are available:

- **Stretch**: Fills the output region by stretching or squeezing the image to fit, which may distort the content.
- **Letterbox**: Preserves the image’s aspect ratio, adding black borders where necessary.
- **Crop**: Zooms in on the centre of the image, cutting off excess content around the edges.
- **Tile**: Repeats the image to fill the available output area.

Use the **AUTO FILL** output option to streamline your mapping process. This feature automatically fills the connected display device with the media, optimising output distribution. If you want your video output to always fill the available screen, regardless of display mode, select this option.
