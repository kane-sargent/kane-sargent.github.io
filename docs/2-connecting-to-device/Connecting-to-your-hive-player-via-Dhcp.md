# Connecting to your hive-player via Dhcp

Step 1: Connecting HDMI Output
Begin by connecting the HDMI output of your Hive player to a monitor or HDMI display
device. This allows you to see the video output from the Hive player. The HDMI output is
set to AUTO by default, ensuring optimal display settings.


Step 2: Connecting Ethernet Output
Connect the Ethernet output of the player to an ethernet router or network device using
an Ethernet cable. The player operates in DHCP mode, expecting a connection to a
network with a DHCP server, such as a home internet router.


Step 3: Powering Up
Plug in the power adapter included with your player to power it up. Once powered, the
player will boot up, and you will be presented with a setup page.
