establishes a hierarchical structure that simplifies control and synchronization across multiple devices. The Queen device operates as the central hub, managing key settings, playback commands, and content distribution. Worker devices, on the other hand, are dependent on the Queen, syncing to its commands and settings for seamless, frame-accurate playback and operations. This structure is particularly useful for large-scale or multi-device installations, where central control over numerous devices is essential to ensure consistency and precision. Understanding how Queen and Worker Mode operates is crucial for setting up and managing a synchronized, multi-device environment."},"queen-and-worker-mode/The-adjust-page-queen-and-worker-mode":{"id":"queen-and-worker-mode/The-adjust-page-queen-and-worker-mode","title":"The Adjust Page: Queen and Worker Mode","description":"In Queen and Worker Mode, the Adjust Page operates differently from standard usage. The Queen has control over most of the configuration settings, while the Workers follow the Queen\u2019s lead for adjustments. However, certain adjustments must still be made independently on each Worker device for precise control over their specific output."},"queen-and-worker-mode/The-map-page-queen-and-worker-mode":{"id":"queen-and-worker-mode/The-map-page-queen-and-worker-mode","title":"The Map Page: Queen and Worker Mode","description":"In Queen and Worker Mode, the Map Page remains independent on each device. While the Queen device maintains control over broader system operations, the map settings and output regions on Worker devices must be managed individually. Unlike other pages, changes made on the Queen\'s Map Page do not affect Worker devices. This ensures that each device\'s mapping can be tailored to its specific needs, allowing flexibility in multi-device setups."},"queen-and-worker-mode/The-media-page-queen-and-worker-mode":{"id":"queen-and-worker-mode/The-media-page-queen-and-worker-mode","title":"The media page queen and worker mode","description":"In Queen and Worker Mode, the Media Page functions slightly differently to maintain synchronized media playback across all devices. While the Queen device has full control over media management, Worker devices are set to follow the Queen\'s commands, ensuring seamless playback and media operations. The Queen is responsible for distributing and triggering media files, while the Workers mirror the Queen\'s actions."},"queen-and-worker-mode/The-play-page-queen-and-worker_mode":{"id":"queen-and-worker-mode/The-play-page-queen-and-worker_mode","title":"Play Page","description":"Play page"},"the-adjust-page/adjust-intro":{"id":"the-adjust-page/adjust-intro","title":"Adjust Page","description":"Image 1","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"the-adjust-page/cloud":{"id":"the-adjust-page/cloud","title":"Cloud","description":"Cloud Image 1","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"the-adjust-page/effects":{"id":"the-adjust-page/effects","title":"Effects","description":"Effects Image 1","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"the-adjust-page/parameters":{"id":"the-adjust-page/parameters","title":"Parameters","description":"Parameters Image 1","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"the-adjust-page/sensors":{"id":"the-adjust-page/sensors","title":"Sensors","description":"Sensors Image 1","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"the-adjust-page/settings":{"id":"the-adjust-page/settings","title":"Settings","description":"The Settings page allows you to configure various device options for your Hive player, such as networking, video, audio output, and more.
