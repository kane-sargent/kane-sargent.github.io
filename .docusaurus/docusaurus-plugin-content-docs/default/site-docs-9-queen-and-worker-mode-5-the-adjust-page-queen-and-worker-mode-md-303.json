  "description": "In Queen and Worker Mode, the Adjust Page operates differently from standard usage. The Queen has control over most of the configuration settings, while the Workers follow the Queenâ€™s lead for adjustments. However, certain adjustments must still be made independently on each Worker device for precise control over their specific output.",
