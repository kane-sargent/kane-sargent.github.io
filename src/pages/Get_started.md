# Getting Started


If you are trying to connect to your HIVE Player[s] on your network you can log in to the HIVE Player by entering the HIVE Players IP address into your browserâ€™s address bar.  The devices IP address is shown on the HDMI output when the HIVE Player has booted and is about to begin playing videos.  It flashes up quite quickly by default, so you may need to use your phone to record the screen in order to read the IP address.  There is a video below which indicates where the IP address is displayed.  


Hive players are shipped in DHCP mode, so to connect for the first time, you should connect them to a network with a simple DHCP server, like an internet router. On a DHCP network your players IP address should be listed in your internet routers configuration page.


If you wish to change your devices IP address for a static address before you have connected through the browser then you can use the maintenance menu, this is accessed by connecting a USB keyboard to the HIVE player and pressing the space bar whilst the device is up and running and playing video.  This menu allows you to set the IP address or DHCP mode manually or view the current status of the device.


If you find your Hive Player keeps rebooting, it may be trying to find a DHCP server on your network. At this point you either need to connect your device to a network with a DHCP server present (like a simple internet router), or you can pull out the network cable from the hive player, then set a fixed IP address on your device from the maintenance menu.
